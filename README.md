## Features List

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can scroll through the deck of cards
- [x] User can check the answers for the questions
- [x] User can create and add new cards in the deck









In this lab we created a deck of cards where we can shuffle through and see the answers as well as create new cards in the deck. 
We used and learned how to use SwiftUI to create basic user interface as well as using gestures and animations. We learned to model data
and also react to user input.
